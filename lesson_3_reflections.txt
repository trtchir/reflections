When would you want to create a remote respository rather then keeping your work local?
To share or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 It might interupt your current work.

 
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is a copy of a repository.  A branch is a split in the repository with their
own commit history.  A fork is a special clone on GitHub that copies a repo for you.
